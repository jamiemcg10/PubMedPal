<br/> 
This program allows a user to search PubMed data by interacting with a chatbot.  

Examples of messages the chatbot will respond to are, \"Search for articles on cancer\", \"Show me articles about obesity after 2018\", \"How many articles about leukemia are there?\", and \"I want to see my search history.\"

The user is then asked to specify whether they want the bot to use a brute force search, a Lucene search, or a MongoDB or MySQL database search. 
<br/>  
Additionally, the user can also ask to see their search history from that session. The chatbot will respond with how many times each search method was used and a chronological list of what the searches were.
